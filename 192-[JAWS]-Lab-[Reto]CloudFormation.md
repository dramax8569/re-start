# AWS re/Start Challenge Lab - Using AWS CloudFormation to Create an AWS VPC and Amazon EC2 Instance

## Lab Overview
This lab provides an environment for creating an Amazon VPC and an Amazon EC2 instance (along with other supporting elements) using an AWS CloudFormation template. The goal of this lab is to create a CloudFormation template with the following components:
* An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* An internet gateway attached to the VPC
* Security groups configured to allow SSH access to the VPC from anywhere
* A private subnet within the VPC
* An Amazon EC2 instance (a T3.micro) within the private subnet (Note: Accessing the EC2 instance via SSH or Remote Desktop is not necessary for a successful solution)

Build and test the lab, iterating the solution until all components are successfully created. Inform the instructor when the template builds without errors so they can review the completed solution.
